                Members of Team Helium are members of the <TextLink new to="https://nihdatacommons.us/">Data Commons Pilot Phase Consortium</TextLink>, the larger team working to build the Data Commons for the <TextLink new to="https://www.nih.gov/">NIH</TextLink>.

                Helium is a highly collaborative and multi-institutional team working with other funded teams to create a Data Commons that transforms the way we access, use, and generate data.
                This vision requires the efforts of a multidisciplinary investigative team with complementary expertise in biomedicine, cloud architecture, software engineering, analytical tools, and data harmonization.
                Each of the eight <NavLink to="dcppc" className="text-link">Key Capabilities</NavLink> (KCs) addresses specific challenges faced by scientists working with large-scale biomedical data.
                The proposed projects are designed such that each KC has unique objectives and deliverables in the form of stand-alone Minimum Viable Products (MVPs), yet together, the KCs form a continuum of insights and approaches that capture the five Vâ€™s of data and reflect FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles.

                The goal is to accelerate new biomedical discoveries by providing a cloud-based platform where investigators can store, share, access and compute on digital objects (data, software, etc.) generated from biomedical research.

                The <TextLink new to="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/">National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</TextLink> (NHLBI), recognizing the importance of the Data Commons project but having its own distinct needs, decided to separate several of the milestones from the Data Commons and fund them as a separate project called DataSTAGE (Storage, Toolspace, Access and analytics for biG data Empowerment).
                Team Helium Plus is working on this unique project.
